Do You Know Immutable Class in Java? Why String is Immutable?

What Is an Immutable Class in Java?

Immutable class means once the object of the class is created its fields cannot be modified or changed. 
In Java, all the wrapper classes like Boolean, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Byte, Char, and String classes are immutable classes.

What Are the Advantages of Immutable Classes?
The following are advantages of immutable classes or objects:

->Object fields (state) cannot be changed or modified.
->It can be passed to any method without worrying about whether that method changes or modifies any of the object fields.
->The object’s hash code can easily be cached.
->These objects are a good choice for keys for Maps.
->These objects are good for a multi-threaded environment as the object's state won’t change.
->An immutable object’s state won’t change, so the same object can be used at multiple places and hence saving the memory.
